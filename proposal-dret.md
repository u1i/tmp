#### Title

API the APIs or Good API Governance through Self-Describing APIs


#### Abstract

With increasing organizational size and complexity of API landscapes, it becomes critically important to have a scalable model of how to manage APIs. When API Products are managed as self-describing products, it becomes easier to create governance models on top of this layer. Governance is about creating a viable model of how to combine oversight and autonomy without introducing bottlenecks that threaten to slow down or stifle the dynamics with which APIs can be created, published, consumed, and improved. We present an approach how through self-describing APIs, it becomes easier to balance oversight and autonomy, and how this can be done in API landscapes which are evolving quickly and across a variety of dimensions.
