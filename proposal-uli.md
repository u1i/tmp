# Uli Hitzel: Workshop: Crawling APIs for Fun and Profit

## Proposal for [API Days Paris](https://www.apidays.co/paris)

### Paris, France, December 9-11, 2019

#### Title

Workshop: Crawling APIs for Fun and Profit


#### Abstract

API landscapes are continuously growing in size and complexity, and organizations are increasingly looking at ways how to manage them in ways that satisfy their need for governance, without introducing bottlenecks that slow down the velocity of how APIs can be designed and delivered. "API the APIs" is an approach that takes a radical look to only use APIs as the way how teams communicate, and it relies on making APIs more self-describing than they are today. In this workshop, we take a detailed look at the technologies and tools that need to be in place for this vision to become reality. We also have a critical look at what's already available in terms of open API standards, and what we as a community have to focus on so that "API the APIs" can progress from vision to reality.
